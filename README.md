Experiment with [Tut](http://tpolecat.github.io/tut//) and some other code/document layout things.

Todos:
- [x] Basic sbt
- [ ] Tut example and config
- [ ] Sbt microsite
- [ ] Mixing regular code examples and tut examples
- [ ] Mix of doc locations
- [ ] Wip handling - e.g. tut stuff in some wip directory that is moved to a real dir eventually

## Maybe links or something go here?
Here's [experiment 1](./target/scala-2.12/tut/Example.md)
